# Deep Learning (CAS machine intelligence) 

This course in deep learning focuses on practical aspects of deep learning. We therefore provide jupyter notebooks ([complete list of notebooks](list_of_notebooks.md) used in the course).

For doing the hands-on part on your own computer you can either install anaconda ([details and installation instruction](anaconda.md)) or use the provided a docker container ([details and installation instruction](docker.md)).

You can also execute the notebooks for the hands-on part on the cloud using binder 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tensorchiefs/dl_course_2018/master?filepath=notebooks) or open them in [colab](list_of_notebooks.md). Note that in this case, changes you made are not presistent and you might want to download the notebooks to your local machine if you made any changes.

To easily follow the course please make sure that you are familiar with the some [basic math and python skills](prerequistites.md). 

## Info for the projects
You can join together in small groups and choose a topic for your DL project. You should prepare a poster and a spotlight talk (5 minutes) which you will present on the last course day. To get some hints how to create a good poster you can check out the links that are provided in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/u1f6mqk4pc3uhxe/poster-guidelines.pdf?dl=1">poster_guidelines.pdf</a> 

If you need free GPU resources, we might want to follow the [instructions how to use google colab](co.md). Help for preparing a hdf5 file from your images you can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_course_2018/blob/master/notebooks/data_prep.ipynb"> example Notebook.</a> 

The projects have been finished and can be found [here](projects.md).

## Other resources
We took inspiration (and sometimes slides / figures) from the following resources.

* Deep Learning Book (DL-Book) [http://www.deeplearningbook.org/](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). This is a quite comprehensive book which goes far beyond the scope of this course.

* Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition [http://cs231n.stanford.edu/](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), has additional material and [youtube videos of the lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC). While the focus is on computer vision, it also treats other topics such as optimization, backpropagation and RNNs. Lecture notes can be found at [http://cs231n.github.io/](http://cs231n.github.io/).

* More TensorFlow examples can be found at [dl_tutorial](https://github.com/oduerr/dl_tutorial/tree/master/tensorflow/) 

* Another applied course in DL: [TensorFlow and Deep Learning without a PhD](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/01/learn-tensorflow-and-deep-learning-without-a-phd)


## Dates
The course is split in 8 sessions, each 4 lectures long.
